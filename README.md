# PIG-Game

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for


It's a simple PIG-Game for everyone. To play you only need a 2'nd player :)

Gameplay. Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or 
the player decides to "hold": If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes 
the next player's turn. If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and 
the player's turn continues.
